# HABITQUEST 🎯

## HabitQuest is a gamified self-growth web platform that transforms habit building into an interactive journey. It integrates habit tracking, learning goals, health tracking, and team collaboration within a single ecosystem.
The platform uses:
🔥 Streak-based rewards
🏆 XP progression system
🧬 Character evolution mechanism
🤝 Team accountability
By converting daily habits into a game-like experience, HabitQuest promotes sustained behavioural transformation rather than simple task completion

### Project Description
HabitQuest is a gamified web platform designed to make habit building engaging and sustainable.
Users earn XP, maintain streaks, and evolve their digital character as they consistently complete habits.
By combining health, learning, task management, and team collaboration, it transforms productivity into an interactive growth journey.

### The Problem statement
Most existing habit and productivity applications focus on tracking tasks rather than enabling long-term behavioural transformation. Users often lose motivation due to lack of engagement, emotional reinforcement, and accountability mechanisms. There is a need for a unified, gamified platform that promotes consistency and sustained self-growth through rewards, visual progress, and collaboration.

### The Solution
HabitQuest solves this problem by transforming habit tracking into a gamified experience. It introduces a streak-based reward system, XP progression, and character evolution to emotionally engage users and encourage consistency. By integrating habit tracking, health goals, learning tasks, and team collaboration in one platform, it builds accountability and promotes long-term behavioural change rather than simple task logging

## Additional Documentation

### For Web Projects with Backend:

#### API Documentation

**Base URL:** HabitQuest does not use a custom REST API with a base URL.
Instead, it integrates directly with Firebase services through the Firebase JavaScript SDK.
However, the Firebase service endpoints internally use :https://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/
https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com/v1/
